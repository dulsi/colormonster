<p><h2>About</h2></p>

<p>Black and white were the only constant colors in the world. Anger could
bring about temporary color but it faded. Until twenty years ago when the
first dye was made. Infused with color, the monsters became incredibly
powerful. Do you have what it takes to master these creatures?</p>

<p>Color Monster is a monster catching game like Pokemon or Digimon primarily
for the TinyArcade platform. It has you color the monsters you use to fight.
The game is in early development. The major systems are being developed and
tested. It is not playable yet.</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://identicalsoftware.com/games/colormonster">open game source article</a> about the development.</p>
